# PhD-Seeker ðŸŽ“

PhD Seeker is a python web scraper to search for fully funded doctorate positions, advertised on well-known academic position websites.

If nowadays you are actively seeking a PhD position to pursue your studies, you must have realized that the process of searching for relevant vacancies is not straight forward. Visiting a large number of position advertising websites and encountering irrelevant commercials are two of the most common problems.

Simply modify the keywords and you will receive a CSV/XLSX file containing the last two pages from the most popular advertisers.
